**Steady State Lid Driven Cavity Using Simple Algorithm - Finite Volume Method**

This project focuses on the numerical simulation of flow inside a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. The study investigates the flow properties at low Reynolds numbers to  achieve a steady-state solution. A pressure correction approach, specifically the  Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations (SIMPLE), is employed to solve  the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The finite volume  discretization (FVM) method is used. The numerical results are validated against benchmark solutions of  cavity flow reported in the literature. Various flow characteristics and results  are analyzed in detail.
