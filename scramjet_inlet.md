**Design of a Scramjet Inlet for Shock-on-Lip Condition at Low Mach Number Using CFD**
In the new era of technology, the Scramjet engine has a big future in both Supersonic and Hypersonic flights. Flow at hypersonic Mach numbers acts in a completely different way than flow at subsonic or supersonic Mach numbers, because air combustion occurs at supersonic speeds, the airflow is compressed from hypersonic to supersonic. A profile of the inlet allows for the decrease of this speed. The project deals to develop a two-dimensional inlet geometry that can function at Mach 4 and 5 without causing flow spillage in the engine, because flow spillage creates drag. This is accomplished by establishing a shock on lip phenomenon, in which all inlet ramp shocks pings at the cowl tip and are reflected back to the isolator. By forming a shock train, this shock is constantly reflected back to the isolator. The compression of airflow at the entry of the combustion chamber at these speeds does not achieve high temperature. As a result, hydrocarbons fuel JP-7 is used for combustion, which has ignition temperature of 514.15 K. The geometry of the inlet is calculated by using the theoretical equation for getting the maximum total pressure ratio. To determine appropriate inlets for Mach 4 and 5, Numerical analysis are used for finding of pressure, temperature, and Mach number.
