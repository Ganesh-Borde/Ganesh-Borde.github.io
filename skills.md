# Programming Languages

- [C/C++](https://www.cprogramming.com/):  
  I started learning this language during my first year of undergraduate studies, which was my first experience with programming. While I didn't use it extensively during my undergraduate years, it became indispensable during my Master's research for scientific computing due to the abundance of scientific libraries written in C/C++. I also used it during the "Tools/Techniques for Scientific Computing" course.

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html):  
  I began using MATLAB during my undergraduate "Numerical Methods" course. Since then, I have regularly used it due to its simplicity and ease of coding without worrying much about syntax and formatting. Most of the data post-processing for my Master's research was done using MATLAB.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/):  
  Python is one of the most popular modern programming languages. I first encountered it during an undergraduate "Python Programming" course. Throughout my graduate studies, I used Python extensively for projects, assignments, and machine learning tasks due to its vast libraries and add-ons.

- [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/):  
  Fortran is one of the best programming languages for scientific computation. During my Master's research, I worked with an in-house code (NGA) compiled in Fortran.

- [Julia](https://julialang.org/):  
  Julia is a modern programming language known for its performance, combining the simplicity of MATLAB and the flexibility of Python. I began using Julia during my Master's "Computational Methods" course, where I realized its excellent performance when working with large datasets.

# Applications

- [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/):  
  I started using Ansys during my undergraduate "CFD" course. It simplified my work compared to coding everything manually. I have used Ansys extensively for various projects, learning it from existing documentation and free training programs.

- [Catia](https://www.3ds.com/products/catia):  
  I used Catia during my undergraduate projects to design 3D models such as small-scale pumps, aircraft designs, and scramjet inlets.

- [Cantera](https://cantera.org/):  
  Cantera is my go-to software for combustion and reactive flow simulations. I used it extensively during my Master's research and the "Fundamentals of Combustion" course.

- [Comsol](https://www.comsol.com/):  
  Comsol is a multiphysics simulation application. I used it in my "Plasma" course to simulate plasma-related problems.

- [Chemkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHEMKIN):  
  Chemkin is a tool for solving complex chemical kinetics problems. I used it during my Master's research.

- [Star CCM+](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/simcenter/fluids-thermal-simulation/star-ccm/?srsltid=AfmBOoqzp3ZCxDm6IsgJDOIQ7TK7_xJDEZV2rjzH_Y1hL9XbkobadI0S):  
  Utilized for advanced computational fluid dynamics and multiphysics simulations.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/):  
  Used for version control, code collaboration, and hosting research projects.

- [MS Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/products-apps-services):  
  Familiar with various Microsoft tools such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams for documentation, analysis, and collaboration.

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/):  
  My preferred text editor and integrated development environment (IDE) for coding projects and debugging.
